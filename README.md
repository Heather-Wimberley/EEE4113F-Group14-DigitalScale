# EEE4113F-Group14-DigitalScale

This project is to create a remote access scale specifically to measure the weight of the Red-Wing Starlings on the campus of the University of Cape Town (UCT). The project was created for the Fitzpatrick Institute as part of the course EEE4113F at UCT.

This project is based on the Raspberry Pi as the microcontroller however, due to time constraints, an esp32 has been used in this initial prototype of the project.
