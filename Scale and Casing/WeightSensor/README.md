# Scale Code Notes

The scale is made from a load cell connected to an HX711 which is then fed into an ESP32. Future versions of the project will interface directly with a Raspberry Pi. There is also a button that has been programmed to tare the scale.

The project can either be opened in VS Code platformio.ini using the file named that in this folder or the code can be viewed in the main.cpp file.
