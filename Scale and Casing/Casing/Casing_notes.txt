The casing for this scale was developed by taking an etch of the bottom of the scale and then creating an appropriately sized case in AutoCad.

This folder includes the AutoCad files as files as the STL files used for 3D printing. There are also additional STL files as the casing had the be printed in 2 parts to fit on the print beds.
